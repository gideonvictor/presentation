					<section>Genesis 37:1-36</section>
					<section>
						37 Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed, the land of Canaan.
						2 This is the account of Jacob’s family line. Joseph, a young man of seventeen, was tending the flocks with his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives, and he brought their father a bad report about them.
						3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than any of his other sons, because he had been born to him in his old age; and he made an ornate[a] robe for him.
					</section>
					<section>
						4 When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them, they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him.
						5 Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers, they hated him all the more.
						6 He said to them, "Listen to this dream I had:
					</section>
					<section>
						7 We were binding sheaves of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright, while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it."
						8 His brothers said to him, "Do you intend to reign over us? Will you actually rule us?" And they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said.
						9 Then he had another dream, and he told it to his brothers. "Listen," he said, "I had another dream, and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me."
					</section>
					<section>
						10 When he told his father as well as his brothers, his father rebuked him and said, "What is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?"
						11 His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind.
					</section>
					<section>
						<b>Joseph Sold by His Brothers </b>
						12 Now his brothers had gone to graze their father’s flocks near Shechem,
						13 and Israel said to Joseph, "As you know, your brothers are grazing the flocks near Shechem. Come, I am going to send you to them." "Very well," he replied.
						14 So he said to him, "Go and see if all is well with your brothers and with the flocks, and bring word back to me." Then he sent him off from the Valley of Hebron. When Joseph arrived at Shechem,
					</section>
					<section>
						15 a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him, "What are you looking for?"
						16 He replied, "I’m looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks?"
						17 "They have moved on from here," the man answered. "I heard them say, ‘Let’s go to Dothan.’" So Joseph went after his brothers and found them near Dothan.
						18 But they saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him.
					</section>
					<section>
						19 "Here comes that dreamer!" they said to each other.
						20 "Come now, let’s kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him. Then we’ll see what comes of his dreams."
						21 When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue him from their hands. "Let’s not take his life," he said.
					</section>
					<section>
						22 "Don’t shed any blood. Throw him into this cistern here in the wilderness, but don’t lay a hand on him." Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father.
						23 So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe—the ornate robe he was wearing—
						24 and they took him and threw him into the cistern. The cistern was empty; there was no water in it.
					</section>
					<section>
						25 As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh, and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt.
						26 Judah said to his brothers, "What will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?
						27 Come, let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; after all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood." His brothers agreed.
					</section>
					<section>
						28 So when the Midianite merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels[b] of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt.
						29 When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes.
						30 He went back to his brothers and said, "The boy isn’t there! Where can I turn now?"
						31 Then they got Joseph’s robe, slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood.
					</section>
					<section>
						32 They took the ornate robe back to their father and said, "We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son’s robe."
						33 He recognized it and said, "It is my son’s robe! Some ferocious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces."
						34 Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days.
					</section>
					<section>
						35 All his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. "No," he said, "I will continue to mourn until I join my son in the grave." So his father wept for him.
						36 Meanwhile, the Midianites[c] sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh’s officials, the captain of the guard.
					</section>
					<section>
						Chapter 39:1-23
					</section>
					<section>
						Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. Potiphar, an Egyptian who was one of Pharaoh’s officials, the captain of the guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites who had taken him there.
						2 The Lord was with Joseph so that he prospered, and he lived in the house of his Egyptian master.
						3 When his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord gave him success in everything he did,
					</section>
					<section>
						4 Joseph found favor in his eyes and became his attendant. Potiphar put him in charge of his household, and he entrusted to his care everything he owned.
						5 From the time he put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned, the Lord blessed the household of the Egyptian because of Joseph. The blessing of the Lord was on everything Potiphar had, both in the house and in the field.
					</section>
					<section>
						6 So Potiphar left everything he had in Joseph’s care; with Joseph in charge, he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate. Now Joseph was well-built and handsome,
						7 and after a while his master’s wife took notice of Joseph and said, "Come to bed with me!"
					</section>
					<section>
						8 But he refused. "With me in charge," he told her, "my master does not concern himself with anything in the house; everything he owns he has entrusted to my care.
						9 No one is greater in this house than I am. My master has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do such a wicked thing and sin against God?"
					</section>
					<section>
						10 And though she spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her or even be with her.
						11 One day he went into the house to attend to his duties, and none of the household servants was inside.
						12 She caught him by his cloak and said, "Come to bed with me!" But he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house.
					</section>
					<section>
						13 When she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house,
						14 she called her household servants. "Look," she said to them, "this Hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us! He came in here to sleep with me, but I screamed.
						15 When he heard me scream for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house."
						16 She kept his cloak beside her until his master came home.
					</section>
					<section>
						17 Then she told him this story: "That Hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me.
						18 But as soon as I screamed for help, he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house."
						19 When his master heard the story his wife told him, saying, "This is how your slave treated me," he burned with anger.
					</section>
					<section>
						20 Joseph’s master took him and put him in prison, the place where the king’s prisoners were confined. But while Joseph was there in the prison,
						21 the Lord was with him; he showed him kindness and granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden.
					</section>
					<section>
						22 So the warden put Joseph in charge of all those held in the prison, and he was made responsible for all that was done there.
						23 The warden paid no attention to anything under Joseph’s care, because the Lord was with Joseph and gave him success in whatever he did.
					</section>
					<section>
						Chapter 40:1-23
					</section>
					<section>
						Some time later, the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt offended their master, the king of Egypt.
						2 Pharaoh was angry with his two officials, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,
						3 and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was confined.
					</section>
					<section>
						4 The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he attended them. After they had been in custody for some time,
						5 each of the two men—the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were being held in prison—had a dream the same night, and each dream had a meaning of its own.
						6 When Joseph came to them the next morning, he saw that they were dejected.
					</section>
					<section>
						7 So he asked Pharaoh’s officials who were in custody with him in his master’s house, "Why do you look so sad today?"
						8 "We both had dreams," they answered, "but there is no one to interpret them." Then Joseph said to them, "Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams."
						9 So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream. He said to him, "In my dream I saw a vine in front of me,
					</section>
					<section>
						10 and on the vine were three branches. As soon as it budded, it blossomed, and its clusters ripened into grapes.
						11 Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into Pharaoh’s cup and put the cup in his hand."
						12 "This is what it means," Joseph said to him. "The three branches are three days.
					</section>
					<section>
						13 Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position, and you will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand, just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer.
						14 But when all goes well with you, remember me and show me kindness; mention me to Pharaoh and get me out of this prison.
						15 I was forcibly carried off from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon."
					</section>
					<section>
						16 When the chief baker saw that Joseph had given a favorable interpretation, he said to Joseph, "I too had a dream: On my head were three baskets of bread.[a]
						17 In the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head."
						18 "This is what it means," Joseph said. "The three baskets are three days.
						19 Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head and impale your body on a pole. And the birds will eat away your flesh."
					</section>
					<section>
						20 Now the third day was Pharaoh’s birthday, and he gave a feast for all his officials. He lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker in the presence of his officials:
						21 He restored the chief cupbearer to his position, so that he once again put the cup into Pharaoh’s hand—
						22 but he impaled the chief baker, just as Joseph had said to them in his interpretation.
						23 The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph; he forgot him.

					First part of Genesis with more historical backing. Egypt is real. Most of the previous stories are looked at from a secular lens as Christian mythology. Joseph gives a much more historical background with the names and descriptions of people, places, and descriptions of the time. Much less poetic language.

					Coat of many colors. Colors in ancient times were expensive. A coat with many colors signified wealth or royalty. This could be looked as a sign that Joseph was royalty and made his brothers jealous.
