					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Businesses pay taxes to build Main Street for people to get to their business.</li>
							<li>Homeowners pay taxes for roads from their home to Main Street. Mixed use <strong>on Main Street</strong> works because tennants don't need roads to get to main street and businesses share the cost water/sewer/police/fire with tennants above.</li>
