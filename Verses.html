				<section>Chapter 1:8-14 8Then a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt.
					9 “Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become far too numerous for us.
					10 Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and,
					if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country.”</section>
				<section>11 So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor,
				and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.
				12 But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread;
				so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites </section>
				<section>13 and worked them ruthlessly.
				14 They made their lives bitter with harsh labor in brick and mortar
				and with all kinds of work in the fields;
				in all their harsh labor the Egyptians worked them ruthlessly.</section>
				<section>Chapter 2</section>
				<section>Now a man of the tribe of Levi married a Levite woman,
					2 and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a fine child,
					she hid him for three months.
					3 But when she could hide him no longer, she got a papyrus basket[b]
					for him and coated it with tar and pitch. Then she placed the child in it
					and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile.
					4 His sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him.</section>
				<section>5 Then Pharaoh’s daughter went down to the Nile to bathe,
					and her attendants were walking along the riverbank.
					She saw the basket among the reeds and sent her female slave to get it.
					6 She opened it and saw the baby.
					He was crying, and she felt sorry for him. “This is one of the Hebrew babies,” she said.</section>
				<section>7 Then his sister asked Pharaoh’s daughter,
					“Shall I go and get one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?”
					8 “Yes, go,” she answered. So the girl went and got the baby’s mother.
					9 Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you.”
					So the woman took the baby and nursed him. 10 When the child grew older,
					she took him to Pharaoh’s daughter and he became her son.
					She named him Moses,[c] saying, “I drew him out of the water.”</section>
				<section>Chapter 3</section>
				<section> Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian,
					and he led the flock to the far side of the wilderness and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.
					2 There the angel of the Lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush.
					Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up.
					3 So Moses thought, “I will go over and see this strange sight—why the bush does not burn up.”</section>
				<section>4 When the Lord saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush, “Moses! Moses!” And Moses said, “Here I am.”
					5 “Do not come any closer,” God said. “Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.”
					6 Then he said, “I am the God of your father,[e] the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.” At this, Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God.</section>
				<section>7 The Lord said, “I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers, and I am concerned about their suffering.
					8 So I have come down to rescue them from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land,
					a land flowing with milk and honey—the home of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites.
					9 And now the cry of the Israelites has reached me, and I have seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing them.
					10 So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt.”</section>
				<section>11 But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?”
					12 And God said, “I will be with you. And this will be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you:
					When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you[f] will worship God on this mountain.”</section>
				<section>13 Moses said to God, “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ Then what shall I tell them?”
					14 God said to Moses, “I am who I am.[g] This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘I am has sent me to you.’”</section>
				<section>15 God also said to Moses, “Say to the Israelites, ‘The Lord,[h] the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob—has sent me to you.’
					“This is my name forever, the name you shall call me from generation to generation.</section>
				<section>16 “Go, assemble the elders of Israel and say to them, ‘The Lord, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob—appeared to me and said:
					I have watched over you and have seen what has been done to you in Egypt.
					17 And I have promised to bring you up out of your misery in Egypt into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites—
					a land flowing with milk and honey.’</section>
				<section>18 “The elders of Israel will listen to you. Then you and the elders are to go to the king of Egypt and say to him, ‘The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us.
					Let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God.’
					19 But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand compels him.
					20 So I will stretch out my hand and strike the Egyptians with all the wonders that I will perform among them. After that, he will let you go.</section>
				<section>21 “And I will make the Egyptians favorably disposed toward this people, so that when you leave you will not go empty-handed.
					22 Every woman is to ask her neighbor and any woman living in her house for articles of silver and gold and for clothing, which you will put on your sons and daughters.
					And so you will plunder the Egyptians.”</section>
				<section>Chapter 4:18-31</section>
				<section>18 Then Moses went back to Jethro his father-in-law and said to him, “Let me return to my own people in Egypt to see if any of them are still alive.” Jethro said, “Go, and I wish you well.”
					19 Now the Lord had said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt, for all those who wanted to kill you are dead.”
					20 So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey and started back to Egypt. And he took the staff of God in his hand.</section>
				<section>21 The Lord said to Moses, “When you return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders I have given you the power to do. But I will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go.
					22 Then say to Pharaoh, ‘This is what the Lord says: Israel is my firstborn son,
					23 and I told you, “Let my son go, so he may worship me.” But you refused to let him go; so I will kill your firstborn son.’”</section>
				<section>24 At a lodging place on the way, the Lord met Moses[j] and was about to kill him.
					25 But Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off her son’s foreskin and touched Moses’ feet with it.[k] “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me,” she said.
					26 So the Lord let him alone. (At that time she said “bridegroom of blood,” referring to circumcision.)</section>
				<section>27 The Lord said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” So he met Moses at the mountain of God and kissed him.
					28 Then Moses told Aaron everything the Lord had sent him to say, and also about all the signs he had commanded him to perform.</section>
				<section>29 Moses and Aaron brought together all the elders of the Israelites,
					30 and Aaron told them everything the Lord had said to Moses. He also performed the signs before the people,
					31 and they believed. And when they heard that the Lord was concerned about them and had seen their misery, they bowed down and worshiped.</section>
